# Installation

To play on a CoD4x enabled server, each player is required to use the CoD4x client. The client can be installed in various ways. Typically, you just connect to any CoD4x server and you will be asked to install the client. Choose to just temporarily run the client, or to install the client to your system, and follow the instructions.

## Installing Updates

Updates to the CoD4x Client are provided via an auto-update system. When starting the client check out the main menu, if you see a button saying "Auto update", press it and the update will be installed to your computer.

## Manual Client Installation

If the automated installer is not working for you, the client can still be installed manually. We provide the files to patch your Call of Duty 4 MW client to Cod4x on our website. The files can be [downloaded here](https://cod4x.ovh/t/cod4x-releases/24). After downloading and unpacking the files, make sure your folder structure looks as outlined below.

```
Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare
├── cod4x_client <<-- your unpacked folder here (will contain a version number) 
    ├── cod4x_021.dll <<-- (version number will be different with newer Cod4X versions in the future)
    ├── crashrpt1403.dll
    ├── install.cmd   
    ├── uninstall.cmd
    ├── <and some more other files>
├── iw3mp.exe                     
├── miles32.dll
├── mss32.dll
├── <and some more other files and folders>
```

At this point just double-click `install.cmd` to install the CoD4x client files. Finally run your game as usual. On the main menu you will now notice that the games version changed from 1.7 to Cod4x 21.1 (or newer).

> Administrative permissions may be required if your game is installed to a protected directory like `C:\Program Files\`

## CoD4x on Mac

A native version of CoD4x is not available for Mac computers. We are sorry for not providing a Mac version of CoD4x, but for the very small audience and our limited resources it is not feasible to support other operating systems natively.

If you still want to run CoD4x on a Mac consider using [Bootcamp](https://support.apple.com/de-at/boot-camp) or [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/products/) a paid solution of wine to rune windows apps in macOS. Crossover can run CoD4x via the instructions below.

1. Run CrossOver from your MAC applications folder and click the Install a Windows Application Button.

2. Type in Call of duty 4 in the application search window.

3. Click on Select Installer. You can try to install COD4 via Steam if you bought it that way. In this instruction we will install from the original DVD. Mount your COD4 DVD and select it from the list or browse where the setup file is with the choose installer file option.

4. Click on Select Bottle. This is basically your unique windows installation. Choose Windows 10 64-bit (Anything past Windows XP as Steam is not supported on that OS anymore).

5. Go to install & Finish and click Install.

6. Click Done. You will maybe see an application window error.. just ignore it. I believe the built in Crossover script runs the wrong setup file if you see this and it doesn't matter.

7. Now click on the show/hide bottles button in the top left corner of CrossOver. You will now see a windows installation named for your COD4 game specifically. Make sure its clicked and click the Run Command... function.

8. Click on the browse button.

9. Go to your mounted DVD or you installation folder and select setup.exe and click open.

10. Click the Run button.

11. The install wizard for COD4 will show up. Install it as usual and click finish at the end.

12. If you did it correctly you should now see an activision folder and MAC containers for your game in CrossOver. Download the COD4 1.6 and 1.7 patch files.

13. Click on Run Command... again.

14. Browse for the 1.6 patch executable and click Run.

15. This patch will take 10+ minutes to load. BE PATIENT! After it loads install like normal.

16. Repeat step 13 for patch 1.7.

17. Download and unzip the Cod4X windows client from the [downloaded here](https://cod4x.ovh/t/cod4x-releases/24). Now right click on the Call of duty 4 bottle on the left side of crossover and click Open C: Drive.

18. Place the unzipped client folder in the "drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Activision/Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare/" folder.
```

            |── cod4x18_v17_9_client <<-- your unpacked folder here
                ├── cod4x_017.dll
                ├── crashrpt1403.dll
                ├── install.cmd   
                ├── uninstall.cmd
                ├── <and some more other files>
            ├── iw3mp.exe

            ├── mss32.dll
            ├── <and some more other files and folders>
```

19. Go back to the CrossOver app and click the Run Command...

20. Click the Browse button.

21. Go to the folder you placed the Cod4x client folder in and select the install.cmd file and click open.

22. Click the Run button.

23. You should see a Done! command window and just press any key to close it. If you see and error you messed up somehow.

24. Some CoD4x servers require steam to run or it will boot you. Download and install the windows version of Steam from [HERE](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/SteamSetup.exe) and use the Run Command... again to select it and click the Run button.

25. Install steam as usual.

26. Now you can should see Steam and COD4 Mac Containers in CrossOver.

27. Run Steam. You have to make an account and log into to steam for it to run with COD4. If you don't have an account MAKE ONE.

28. After logging in click on the + ADD A GAME button in the bottom left corner and click Add a Non-Steam Game..

29. Select the single player and multiplayer COD4 games check boxes and click ADD SELECTED PROGRAMS.

30. Thats it folks. Now run COD4 Multiplayer from Crossover by double clicking it. You will have to close and open it a few times to get your settings right. There is one bug though. If COD4 minimizes it looses the mouse. You have to just close and open COD4 again and you will be fine. You just have to open steam and make sure you logged in and run COD4 separately each time. 

## Cod4x on Linux

Linux can run the CoD4x Client via Wine to run the windows game client and steam natively. The following are instructions for Ubuntu 19.10 via the terimal. Adjust the commands accordingly per your distro and username and file locations.

1. Run the terminal commands to install the latest version of wine and enable support for 32 bit apps.
```
sudo apt remove winehq-stable wine-stable wine1.6 wine-mono wine-geco winetricks
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
wget -qO - https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-add-repository "deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main"
sudo apt update && sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable
```

2. Check the version of wine to make sure it is up to date.
```
wine --version
```

3. Wine will install a hidden c drive directory to mimic the windows file structure: /home/YourUserName/.wine/drive_c/
```
drive_c
├── ProgramData
    ├── <and some more other files>
├── Program Files
    ├── <and some more other files>                     
├── Program Files (x86) <<-- This is where Steam and Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare will be installed.
    ├── <and some more other files>
├── users
    ├── YourUserName
├── windows
```

4. The latest version of Cod4x has steam support and servers enforce this. Download the windows steam setup executable. Go to your download directory and run it via wine. **NEVER USE ROOT/SUPER USER FOR WINE COMMANDS!**.
```
cd /home/YourUserName/Downloads
wine SteamSetup.exe
```

5. If the steam setup gives you an issue with the steam folder existing already delete it and then continue.
```
cd '/home/YourUserName/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/'
rm -R Steam
```

6. Your drive_c directory should now have Steam installed.
```
drive_c
├── ProgramData
    ├── <and some more other files>
├── Program Files
    ├── <and some more other files>

    ├── Steam
        ├── <and some more other files>
    ├── <and some more other files>
├── users
    ├── YourUserName
        ├── <and some more other files>
    ├── <and some more other files>
├── windows
    ├── <and some more other files>
```

7. Go to where your Call of Duty 4 setup is located/mounted and run the setup executable via wine. If you have purchased Call of Duty 4 via Steam skip steps 7-9.
```
cd /media/YourUserName/COD4MW
wine Setup.exe
```

8. Your drive_c directory should now have Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare installed.
```
drive_c
├── ProgramData
    ├── <and some more other files>
├── Program Files
    ├── <and some more other files>

    ├── YourUserName
        ├── <and some more other files>
    ├── <and some more other files>
├── windows
    ├── <and some more other files>
```

8. Download and install the official Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare 1.6 Patch and run the setup via wine. **It might hang for 10 minutes just be patient and wait**.
```
cd /home/YourUserName/Downloads
wine cod4mw-1.6-patchsetup.exe
```

9. Download and install the official Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare 1.7 Patch and run the setup via wine.
```
cd /home/YourUserName/Downloads
wine cod4mw-1.7-patchsetup.exe
```

10. To play on a CoD4x 1.8+ enabled server, each player is required to use the CoD4x client. The client can be installed in various ways. Typically, you just run the non Cod4x 1.8 client via wine and connect to any CoD4x 1.8+ server and you will be asked to install the client. 
```
cd '/home/YourUserName/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Activision/Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare'
wine iw3mp.exe
```

11. If the automated installer is not working for you because of steam not running, the client can still be installed manually. We provide the files to patch your Call of Duty 4 MW client to 1.8 on our website. The files can be [downloaded here](https://cod4x.me/downloads/cod4x_client.zip). After downloading and unpacking the files, make sure your folder structure looks as outlined below (if installed via steam locate where it is installed).
```

    ├── YourUserName
        ├── <and some more other files>
    ├── <and some more other files>
├── windows
    ├── <and some more other files>
```

Go to your cod4x18_v17_9_client folder directory and run the install.cmd script using the command interpreter with wine.
```
cd '/home/YourUserName/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Activision/Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare/cod4x18_v17_9_client'
wine cmd.exe /C install.cmd
```

If the install.cmd script executed correctly you should see the cod4x_017 folder and files in "/home/YourUserName/.wine/drive_c/users/YourUserName/Local Settings/Application Data/CallofDuty4MW/bin/cod4x_017"

12. Run Steam via wine using special arguments -no-cef-sandbox. **They must be used or steam's web forms wont load.**. Log into your steam account name. If you do have one create one. Servers will kick you if you are not running the CoD4x client through steam. Your Steam page name will be used when joining servers which is different from your steam account name. This can be changed at any time so name your steam account name anything.
```
cd '/home/YourUserName/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam'
wine Steam.exe -no-cef-sandbox
```

13. If you have purchased Call of Duty 4 via Steam skip this step. Click on the top menu **Games** -> **Add a Non-Steam Game To My Library**. Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare Single Player and Multiplayer should show up. Check them both and click **Add Selected Programs**.

14. Click on the top menu **Games** -> **Vew Games Library**. Click on Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare Multiplayer and click the big green Play button. You should see the steam overlow show up in the bottom right corner as well as the number 17.9. Join a server and play. If you see an error like below its because the user application data files are not in the right directory and you need to place them there manually via the install.cmd script or by joining a server with the latest patch.
